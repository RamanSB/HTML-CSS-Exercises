            <h4>Java</h4>
            <p>Java was a language I had taught myself. The second language I had exposure too. I then
              obtained an Oracle certification (Associate & Professional) & decided to make an 
              <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ramansb.fourcorners">Android App too.</a>
              Learnt a bit about Android Dev. Check out my App here. Java is my bread & butter. 
              I'll upload some samples of what the Java 17 release has in another repository.

            <h4>Javascript</h4>
            <p>After developing UI's in Android Studio - I tried out flutter which uses Dart, but wasn't to keen on it.
              As I wanted to use something to build side projects that is also mainstream enough to use in a corporate environment.
              That's when I decided to learn Javascript, starting with Eloquent Javascript book.
              I now spend my sparetime becoming proficient in the MERN stack so I can make my own projects.

            <h4>Python</h4>
            <p>Once I've become proficient with the MERN stack. I want to get back to using Python (the first language
              I encountered during university [Physics]). I want to write trading algorithms & data analtics/science scripts
              to analyze financial markets, etc... It requires knowledge of maths and I miss that about Physics.

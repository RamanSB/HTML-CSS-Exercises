I have been learning the MERN stack which uses React to make the front-end UI, however my UI's weren't as pleasent as I expected, so I've decided to brush up on my HTML & CSS, the exercises in this directory are taken from: https://github.com/lewagon/html-css-challenges/tree/master/01-profile-content-new"
